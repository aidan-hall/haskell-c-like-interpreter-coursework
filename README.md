# cswk-program

This is the skeleton code for the second coursework in the 2022
iteration of CS141 Functional Programming at the University of
Warwick.

## Technology & Resources
- [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec), a monadic
  parsing library.
- [Megaparsec Tutorial](https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/megaparsec.html)
## Project
An esoteric programming language?

### Criteria
* Funny
* Turing-complete?
* Justifiable to use *Parsec: Some amount of structure will be
  advisable.
* Possibly something to do with stacks
* Unicode

## Language Design
* Don't try to make Haskell!
* Everything is based on composition of primitives:
  * `add`, `multiply`, `divide`, `subtract`
  * `define`,
