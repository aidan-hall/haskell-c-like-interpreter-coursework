* Project Ideas
** An esoteric programming language?
Criteria:
- Funny
- Turing-complete?
- Justifiable to use *Parsec: Some amount of structure will be
  advisable.
- Possibly something to do with stacks
- Unicode
** Zork Command Interpreter
- Probably out of scope for 141.
** Basic-Like Language Interpreter
- Saves the mental overhead of designing a language.
- Recognisable product.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Syntax
- Macros: Simple features → Structure?
- One statement per line (easy parsing).
- Use an array/vector for lines: Faster indexed access.
- If/while/for/do loops: Stacks to track depth.
- Loop start line: Push address to stack.
- ~continue~: Pop
- MegaParsec application: Read strings; convert to symbolic form.
- Mini C (Compiler Design).
** BF Interpreter
- Very straightforward.
- You have your own implementation as a reference?
- Focus on style rather than panic.
** Forth
- A ready-made syntax very much like what you had in mind!
- Word-by-word operation:
  - Join whole program input into one ~String~, then use ~words~?
  - Might be more flexible to use Megaparsec for this stuff.
- Forth is a “real” language, so yours can just steal some of its
  ideas, rather than being an implementation of any subset of it.
- No formal grammar: This was the big issue with using a parsing
  library for it: Overkill?!
*** Useful Notions
- Compilation and Interpretation Semantics.
- Macros.
*** Parser Syntax
Word definition:
#+begin_example
: name [words...] ;
#+end_example

Interpretation:
#+begin_example
word
#+end_example

* Funny Stack Language Design
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: language-design
   :END:
This section is useless but I don't have the heart to remove it.
- Don't try to make Haskell!
- Inspired by ~dc~?
- Everything is a stack.
- (‘Forward’ or Reverse) Polish notation?
- Function calls and data in the same stack.
- Start as an extension of RPN, and work up.
- Stack can have numbers, strings and functions.
- Functions 
- Everything is based on composition of primitives:
  - ~add~, ~multiply~, ~divide~, ~subtract~
  - ~define~: Pop values, and push them into a named stack.
  - ~push~: Can be applied to functions, allowing wacky stuff.
- Conditionals: "Eval if X > 0?"
- Problem: Needs to be interesting to evaluate with Megaparsec.
- Big problem: Needs to be a good project for 2 weeks.

| Symbol  | Meaning                                           |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------|
| .       | Terminate: Marks the end of input for a function. |
| @       | Evaluate: Pop a string, and copy from that stack. |
| +,-,*,/ | Maths functions.                                  |
| :       | Define (copy into that stack)                     |
| ~       | Swap the top two elements on the stack.           |
| ?       | If top value is zero, pop the second one as well. |
| >       | Read a number as input; push it to data stack.    |
** Stacks
- Input Stack :: All input symbols are placed on here.  The contents
  are evaluated when the evaluate symbol (@) is reached.
- Data Stack :: Classic RPN stack.
- Named Stacks :: Symbols can be copied in and out of these to create
  macros. E.g. double: ~2 *~.
** Examples
*** Maths
1 + 2 - 3
#+begin_src
  . 3 . 2 1 + @ - @
  . 3 . 2 1 + @ (-)
  . 3 . 2 1 0 (+ -)
  . 3 . 2 1 (+ -)
  . 3 . 3 (+ -)
  . 3 3 (-)
  0
#+end_src
Making character substitutions so (R)PN is more apparent makes it
obvious that I'm not doing anything particularly innovative.
#+begin_src
  ( 3 ( 2 1 + ) - )
  ( 3 ( 2 1 + ) (-)
  ( 3 ( 2 1 (+ -)
  ( 3 ( 2 1 (+ -)
  ( 3 ( 3 (+ -)
  ( 3 3 (-)
  0
#+end_src

#+begin_src
  . 2 1 + 3 - @
#+end_src

*** Fibonacci
#+begin_example
push 
#+end_example

* Relevant Working Notes
- Having a ~ParsecT~ stacked on top of a ~Map~ for variable values
  might be a nice idea.
